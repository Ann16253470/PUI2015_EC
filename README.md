# PUI2015_EC
Please upload your Extra Credit project as a directory in this repository. In order to do this: 

1) make a fork of this repository (the fork button is on the top right of your github screen ![alt text](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2015_EC/blob/master/fb55_EC/Screen%20Shot%202015-12-13%20at%203.34.52%20PM.png)
) and make a clone of the fork on your machine

e.g. git clone https://github.com/... 

the full URL will appear in the HTTPS box in your fork ![alt text](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2015_EC/blob/master/fb55_EC/Screen%20Shot%202015-12-13%20at%203.35.02%20PM.png)

2) on your local copy (inside the PUI2015_EC directory create a folder with your NYUid <NYUid>_EC)

3) move the code and documents you want to submit for your EC project to the directory you just created

4) add the directory to the repository 

e.g. git add fb55_EC

5) commit your changes and push them (notice that when you fork and clone the repository you will get all the projects in it. this is fine, becuase we like transparency and we do not mind our work being publicly accessible, it would be if they were in your own repo as well. But also it means if anyone copies really large files then we all get them on our machines: **DO NOT COMMIT LARGE DATA FILES!** when in doube ask me. if a large data file is needed for reproducibility we can find another way for me to get them from you.

6) issue a pull request. the New Pull Request button is on the left of your screen. ![alt text](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2015_EC/blob/master/fb55_EC/Screen%20Shot%202015-12-13%20at%203.35.02%20PM.png) 
This way I can include the changes to the original repo (you are working on your own fork so unless you do this I will not see your work).

7) you will recieve a message that confirms your pull request was accepted when I do. otherwise contact me.
